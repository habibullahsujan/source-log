              <p className=''>The story of <Link href={'https://www.thehersheycompany.com/en_us/home.html'} className='font-bold'>Hershey&apos;s chocolate</Link> begins In the late 19th century with Milton S. Hershey, a young man with a passion for sweets. After facing initial failures in the caramel business, Hershey turned his attention to chocolate, aiming to create an affordable and accessible treat for the masses. In 1894, he founded the Hershey Chocolate Company, laying the foundation for the chocolate empire we know today.
              </p>
              <p className='py-2'>Hershey&apos;s innovative spirit was evident in his quest to improve his chocolate recipe. He experimented with different ratios of milk to cocoa, eventually developing a unique blend that offered a smooth, creamy texture and distinct sweetness. This distinctive flavour, which differs from the darker, more bitter European chocolate, has become Hershey&apos;s hallmark and remains a favorite among generations of consumers.</p>

              <h2 className='text-xl font-bold pt-14 pb-2 text-[#00563B]'>The science behind sweetness:</h2>


              <p className='text-lg py-3'>Hershey&apos;s chocolate undergoes a precise production process that ensures consistent quality and taste. The journey begins with cocoa beans sourced from different regions around the world. These beans are roasted, winnowed and ground into the cocoa mass that forms the chocolate base. The cocoa mass is then combined with cocoa butter, sugar, milk and other ingredients to create Hershey&apos;s signature flavour.</p>

              <p className='text-lg py-2'>One of the unique aspects of Hershey&apos;s chocolate lies in its use of “Dutch Process Cocoa,” also known as Alkaline Cocoa. This process neutralizes the natural acidity of the cocoa, resulting in a smoother, smoother taste compared to non-alkalized cocoa. This unique characteristic contributes greatly to the distinctive sweetness and creaminess that characterizes Hershey&apos;s chocolate.</p>

              <h3 className='font-bold text-lg text-[#00563B]'>More than a treat: Hershey&apos;s cultural impact</h3>
              <p className='py-2'>Hershey&apos;s Chocolate has transcended its role as a mere confectionery product to become an integral part of American culture. Distinctive packaging, familiar advertising campaigns and association with childhood memories have cemented Hershey as a symbol of comfort, joy and shared experiences.</p>
              <p className='py-2'>The brand also played an important role in shaping American candy culture. The affordability and accessibility of Hershey&apos;s chocolate has ensured that people from all walks of life enjoy these sweets. In addition, innovative marketing campaigns, featuring memorable characters such as Milton Hershey and Chocolate Quesibles, strengthened the brand&apos;s connection with consumers across generations.</p>
